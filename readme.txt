1. What was hard? The main difficulty was to understand the basic JS concepts of Async but now it's
more clear and this is really cool.
2. What was fun? I find it fun learning JS because without this course I don't think I would have took
the time to learn it. I'm amazed every time that I write a JS file and it works.
3. Nothing really. just made all IO in the server Async and it works really nice.
For some reason my load.js gives me a very slow rate of ~65 responses \ sec.
I also created (included in the zip) a small Jmeter script which loads the server with 25 threads that
are requesting the ex2 index.html page in a loop. This gave me a nice rate of > 1000 responses \ sec
